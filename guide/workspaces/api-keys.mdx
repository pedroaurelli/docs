API Keys in Cogfy Messenger allow developers to integrate external applications with the platform securely. Each workspace can generate its own API keys, ensuring that all API requests and data access are restricted to that specific workspace — providing both flexibility and strong access control for custom integrations.

> To manage workspace API Keys, visit [messenger.cogfy.com/:WORKSPACE/api-keys](https://messenger.cogfy.com/:WORKSPACE/api-keys).

<Warning>

The API key is displayed only once right after it is created. Make sure to copy and store it in a secure location, as it will not be visible again for security reasons.
