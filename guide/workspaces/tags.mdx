Tags in Cogfy Messenger allow you to organize and segment users efficiently. You can assign tags to users and create smart routing rules, ensuring that messages sent to a specific phone number are handled only by the user associated with a given tag. This helps automate workflows, maintain clear ownership, and deliver personalized communication experiences.
