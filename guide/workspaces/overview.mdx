## Workspace

The Cogfy Messenger workspace system allows users to create and manage multiple independent workspaces, each with its own settings, integrations, and team members — making it easy to organize conversations, automate processes, and collaborate across different projects or clients.

Users can easily switch between their workspaces directly from the **Profile** page at [messenger.cogfy.com/profile](https://messenger.cogfy.com/profile), allowing seamless navigation and management across different teams or projects within the same account.

## Settings

To manage your workspace settings, visit [messenger.cogfy.com/:WORKSPACE/settings](https://messenger.cogfy.com/:WORKSPACE/settings). Here, you can configure preferences, manage integrations, invite team members, and customize your workspace to fit your needs.
